# Workshop AI for Justice, June 2025
Code and demos for the Workshop AI for Justice, 11-12 of June 2025

## Practice part 1: Retrieval Augmented Generation and chatbots

### Goal: 
Participants a divided in 2 groups (participants may choose which group they want to join)
Group 1: Advanced use of chatbots (prompting, deep research,...)
Group 2: (participants with programming experience) build a prototype RAG system to archive data, understand how it works and the limits. Reflect on the limitations.

## Practice part 2: AI for video, images and audio

### Goal: 
get to know AI models to extract information from video, audio and images.

## Practice part 3: Understanding the AI representation of data

### Goal: 
Deeper exploration of AI tools seen in Practice 2.  Experiments with Google [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/). Understanding how AI models see similarities in the data, opening the “brain” of an AI model.

### Resources: 
The notebook `simplified_embeddings.ipynb` show how text information is structured in the "AI brain". It can be run online by clicking on "Open in Colab" <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/AIforJustice/workshop-June-2025/blob/main/simplified_embeddings.ipynb">

</a>. 


## Practice part 4: Further developing AI for archiving: 

### Goal: 
Open session for the participants' projects, combining the AI see in part 1,2 and 3.                  
Participants work on real-world archive data in teams (or their own data), developing further an archiving system or some data analysis. The teaching team assists the teams in their projects.
